/**
 * Column Definition
 *
 * Represents a column transformation/remap rule.
 *
 * For example, we may have a data source that has the column "id" which we want to
 * populate in the "uuid" column of our internal data structure.
 * E.G
 * array(array('id' => '1'))
 *
 * To do this, we would create a ColumnDefinition which specifies that the data should
 * come FROM "id" and be remapped to "uuid". So after running our filter, our data now looks like
 * array(array('uuid'=> '1')).
 *
 * We can also specify filters which are small functions that are able to filter/transform the data
 * that we are remapping. For example, we know that the ID is always an integer but readers converts
 * all types to strings so if we tried to pass the ID to a method which only accepted ints, it would not work.
 *
 * To solve this, we could register a new Integer filter.
 * $columnDef->registerFilter(new \NDM\Bundle\TryCatch\ApiBundle\Ingester\Filter\IntegerFilter());
 *
 * which would result in
 * array(array('id' => '1'))
 * being converted to
 * array(array('uuid' => 1))
